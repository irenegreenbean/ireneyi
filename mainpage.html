<p>Hi! My name is Irene Yi. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at Stanford University. My work mainly concerns questions of sociolinguistics, phonetics, sound change, and speech perception. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I tend to use experimental and fieldwork methods. Most of my work is on Chinese dialects and languages.</p>

<p>Come back later to see a much more updated website!!</p>
