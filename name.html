Hi! My name is Irene Yi. I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at Stanford University. My work mainly concerns questions of sociolinguistics, phonetics, sound change, and speech perception. I tend to use experimental and fieldwork methods. Most of my work is on Chinese dialects and languages. Come back later to see a much more updated website!!
